# React Picture Gallery

For this project I created a gallery page to share pictures that are important to me.  The page is interactive allowing a viewer to click an image to see a description of the picture, and use a "like" button to like an image. The number of likes clicks updates in real time and is displayed as well.

## Description

This project was completed using react to update specific parts of the DOM in real time as well as axios to connect the client and server side of the project using GET and PUT calls.
